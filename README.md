Python-Django project - homework for URFU Python course.

Project stack is Python/Django/HTML/CSS/JS.
Client-server works like JSON-RPC arc. 

JSON-RPC

To start project you have to create `.env` file, end create `SECRET_KEY` var there, so the project can start.

Then run following command:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

And the server will start at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Here you can create account, and simple login-password lists.
